 *	This is an example program that demonstrates the use of
 *	stream sockets as an IPC mechanism.  This contains the client,
 *	and is intended to operate in conjunction with the server
 *	program.  Together, these two programs
 *	demonstrate many of the features of sockets, as well as good
 *	conventions for using these features.
