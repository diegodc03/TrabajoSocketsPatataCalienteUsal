 *
 *	This is an example program that demonstrates the use of
 *	sockets as an IPC mechanism.  This contains the client,
 *	and is intended to operate in conjunction with the server
 *	program.  Together, these two programs
 *	demonstrate many of the features of sockets, as well as good
 *	conventions for using these features.
 *
 *
 *	This program will request the internet address of a target
 *	host by name from the serving host.  The serving host
 *	will return the requested internet address as a response,
 *	and will return an address of all ones if it does not recognize
 *	the host name.
